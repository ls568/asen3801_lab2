function DCM = RotationMatrix313(attitude313)

% Goal: use the Euler angles for the 3-1-3 rotation sequence to calculate 
% the associated DCM.

% Inputs:
% attitude313: 3 x 1 vector with the 3-1-3 Euler angles in the form 
% attitude313 = [alpha, beta, gamma]'

% Outputs:
% DCM: the rotation matrix calculated from the Euler angles.
