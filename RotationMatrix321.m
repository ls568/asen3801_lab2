function DCM = RotationMatrix321(attitude321)

% Goal: use the Euler angles for the 3-2-1 rotation sequence to calculate 
% the associated DCM.

% Inputs:
% attitude321: 3 x 1 vector with the 3-2-1 Euler angles in the form 
% attitude321 = [alpha, beta, gamma]' (In ASEN 3728 notation, this would 
% be equivalent to [phi, theta, psi]').

% Outputs:
% DCM: the rotation matrix calculated from the Euler angles.
