function attitude321 = EulerAngles321(DCM)

% Goal: use the DCM to extract the 3-2-1 Euler angles

% Inputs:
% DCM: a rotation matrix

% Outputs:
% attitude321: 3 x 1 vector with the 3-2-1 Euler angles in the form 
% attitude321 = [alpha, beta, gamma]' (In ASEN 3728 notation, this would be
% equivalent to [phi, theta, psi]'.
